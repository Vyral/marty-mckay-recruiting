<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a brokerage or are a newer agent just recently getting started. Perhaps you’ve been in the industry for a couple of years, but you find yourself lacking the kind of consistency, income, and support you desire.</p>

<p><strong>There are roughly 13-14,000 agents in the Salt Lake Valley, with new ones starting each day.</strong> There’s a lot of competition in the valley, now including discount “brokerages” who are trading sloppy work for a cheap “commission.”</p>

<p>For some people, this can be painful. In fact, a lack of sufficient training, education, and business leads to many agents leaving the industry altogether. Studies show that 87% of real estate agents leave the business within the first three years of getting their licenses.</p>

<p>Agents like this run out of money, get distracted, and fall flat in their career due to a lack of support. They are unable to generate and convert the consistent flow of qualified leads needed to prosper in the business.</p>

<p>This leads to a lot of uncertainty and stress. People have no idea whether they will see another paycheck after their next contract. And of the insufficient and inconsistent income they may be producing now, how much of it is going right back into paying for marketing expenses, training, and other costs not covered by their brokerage? A lack of flexibility and the prospect of financial ruin is enough to drive anyone crazy.</p>

<p>The truth is, some agents just aren’t prepared for the industry. On my team, we ensure that our agents are given the tools, systems, training, and support they need to be successful and reach their goals. We hold our agents accountable. When we see potential in an agent, we expect that agent to use it.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Marty McKay and I’ve been in real estate since 2008.</strong> Although I couldn’t have picked a worse time to start my career than during the housing market crash, those limitations within the economy allowed me to learn how to draw on education for support. When I finally learned more about how teams work, I realized the potential of a high-quality team and how much better things could be. I not only wanted to be part of that type of culture, but I also wanted to create a team of my own agents, whom I could provide the proper training and support to that would make agents want to line up to join.</p>

<p>I have a deep, personal desire to help others succeed. I want to provide quality leads and training that will give you the framework to be successful. Our team family provides the support, and hence the confidence, to be a successful agent.</p>


<p>Our culture makes us unique in the real estate world. We are a generous brokerage. All our agents are well cared for and given the tools to build successful real estate careers; our team culture is one of support, not cutthroat competition. We hold you accountable to your leads and teach you how to dedicate time and effort to being a responsible agent. <strong>We believe in honest, open communication and live by the credo: “Have fun. Help People. Make Money.”</strong></p>


<p>I can offer you the following:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Weekly training</li>
<li>Full-staff check-ins three times per week</li>
<li>Regular one-on-one meetings with me</li>
<li>Structured time for prospecting and lead generation</li>
<li>Education and coaching to help you leverage your strengths and generate leads in any type of market</li>
<li>A 40/60 split with tiers up to 60%</li>
<li>No franchise fees or additional brokerage splits or fees</li>
<li>Constant leads</li>
<li>The latest software</li>
<li>Office space</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You could continue at your current pace—making inconsistent income, paying for your own marketing and advertising expenses, and having little freedom in your life and career. You could join a brokerage who over-hypes their training without backing it up. You could also simply quit and take on a 9-to-5 job where you have no flexibility and no fun. Or, you could take the first step on the road to success and join my team.</p>

<p>From day one, you’ll get to work. You will start a systemized, aggressive 90-day “Take Action Plan” to get you up and running in the shortest time possible.</p>

<p><strong>The onboarding process will include:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Coaching and education—they are a priority here</li>
<li>Training sessions with our buyer agent team manager</li>
<li>Multiple ride-along and shadowing opportunities with experienced agents</li>
<li>Studying and mastering our basic dialogue outlines</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Don’t just take my word for it. One of our newest agents, Tanya, was an escrow officer for 14 years and had an opportunity for a job change. She was fed up with dealing with the real estate industry and was looking in other job areas when one of our agents convinced her that McKay Realty was different. Tanya saw our high standards, the way we treat our agents, our clients, and the other officers we work with, and she decided to give it a shot. She jumped in with a team attitude, embraced our culture, and closed 14 deals within her first nine months!</p>

<p><strong>Avoid the shifting sands of inconsistent and unpredictable real estate business and join our rock of a team where we will provide structure, support, and direction!</strong> Here, you will fortify your mindset, skills, and—most importantly—your database, so you can know for certain that you will succeed in real estate, no matter what comes your way. I’m here to help you: let’s do this! Is there any reason not to start today?</p>

<p>I look forward to talking with you soon.</p>
